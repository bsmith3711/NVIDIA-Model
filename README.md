# NVIDIA-Model
Discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation model for NVIDIA Corp

Hello,

This repo includes a DCF model I created from NVIDIAs last 3 years of financial statements. The model has three built-in "cases" including a base case, an upside case, and a downside case.

I find this model funny because it goes to show that even the most comprehensive model can't always predict stock price. Is NVIDIA over-valued like my model suggests? It's not so simple.

In any case, this is just one of many DCF models that I've created since building them in college while taking courses such as:

- Quantatative Analysis for Business & Finance
- Investments
- Large Investments & International Project Finance
- Equity Valuation
- and more...

These days, models like this can be sueful in certain investment consideration scenarios, but don't stand a chance against high-frequency trading and AI/ML driven stock analysis.
